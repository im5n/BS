Download an prebuilt from the [prebuilts section](#prebuilts), or build an image your self with the above commands.  
On Windows, use Rufus to flash.
On Linux, use dd as follows:
```sh
sudo dd if=/path/to/badsh1mmer.bin of=/dev/sdX bs=1M status=progress
```
(remember to replace X with the actual usb's letter identifier)
### I have a usb, what now?
